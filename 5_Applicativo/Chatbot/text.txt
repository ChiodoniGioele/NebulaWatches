                    If there are no watch references don't put anything:
                    Forbidden, not valid, should not respond with this, example:
                    1. !watch_reference[]  -->  this should not be present because it's blank.
                    2. Il tuo username Ã¨ sus@sus.sus.
                       !watch_reference[]  --> should not be present because it's blank.

                       At the end of every response, only where there is at least one watch involved, add a list
                    of every watch reference in the following format, only if there are watch references:
                    !watch_reference[<watch_reference_value>];!watch_reference[<watch_reference_value2>];!watch_reference[<watch_reference_value3>]
